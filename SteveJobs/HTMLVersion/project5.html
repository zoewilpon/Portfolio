        Steve Jobs was the co-founder and CEO of Apple Inc. 
        He is widely considered to be a brilliant businessman, 
        as well as one of the greatest tech visionaries of our time.

        The story of his life is nothing short of fascinating. 
        After dropping out of college, he started Apple with his 
        friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">
        Steve Wozniak</a> in 1976 at the age of 21. The duo gained wealth
        and fame a year later for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">
        Apple II </a>, one of the first highly successful mass-<br> produced
        personal computers. This was following a very successful Macintosh in 1984, 
        the first mass-produced computer with GUI (graphical user interface). After being oused
        of Apple in 10985, he went on to oversee the creation of two new <br> companies: NeXT computer 
        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar"> Pixar. </a> With the success of the movie 
        Toy Story, Steve became a billionaire.

    <p>
        In 1997, Steve returned to Apple. Bill Gates and Microsoft dominated the computer industry, and Apple 
        was on the brink of extinction. Nonetheless, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field">
        Steve was a fantastic salesman,</a> and used his business acumen to slowly bring the company back to <br>
        profitability.
